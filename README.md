# cs180proj0

## How to Run

- Open `index.html` directly in your browser (no build needed), or
- Serve the folder with a simple static server to avoid any local file restrictions:
  - Python 3: `python3 -m http.server 8000` then visit http://localhost:8000
  - Node.js: `npx serve .` then visit the shown URL

That's it â€” this is a static site using `assets/styles.css` and files in `images/`.
